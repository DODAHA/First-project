        <p>Hello, this is dodaha and I'm the man behind this idea that became a company.
This idea emerged in 2016 and was changing and evolving as I acquired more knowledge, as of the writing of this text (2020)
I still have a lot to learn, but all in due time.
I know that in the future I will need more help but for now it is and I am fine.
Many things will change this year including this project that I have, which will evolve to become a help to the world.
So as you may have already noticed I am a highly sober (not boring) minimalist businessman wanting to finish this global project and this is the beginning of the end.
Enjoy!</p>
